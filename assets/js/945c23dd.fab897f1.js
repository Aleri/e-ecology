Forest ecosystems rank first among other terrestrial ecosystems in terms of degree and versatility of ecological and economic importance. To a large extent, all other natural resources in a given area depend on them. The species composition, biomass, production, and included chemical elements in forest plant communities determine more than 80% of the features of all other coenoses and, in general, the functioning of ecosystems. The study of other components is necessary to determine regulatory mechanisms in ecosystems, indicate changes, and provide diagnostics. Based mainly on data for functional indicators, the following are possible: 1. The development of various types of models for simulating the "behavior" of macrobiological systems for assessment and prediction purposes; 2. Modeling the ecotoxicological effects of pollutants; 3. Assessing potential and actual ecosystem services; 4.

Some progress in this regard has been made with the development of projects related to monitoring forest ecosystems in Europe, as well as the development of theory and practice for assessing ecosystem services. However, the lack of sufficient knowledge remains a reason for accelerated rates of negative anthropogenic influence on natural systems, which outpace our understanding of their functioning. To compensate for this negative trend for the biosphere, the ecological community mainly engages in continuous inventory related to determining the threat category of species and habitats, mapping them, monitoring, and conservation efforts. Inventories primarily rely on structural indicators, which are less reflective of functional interrelationships. However, along with characteristics such as occupied area, species composition, phytocenoses structure, amount of dead mass, soil characteristics, and anthropogenic influences, it is crucial to assess the potential and real importance of the services provided by mapped habitats by characterizing their functional capabilities. This includes their role as a source of biomass, bioproduction, and oxygen, as well as a repository of carbon and chemical elements, and their participation in local and global biological and biosphere cycles. Based on this characterization, a realistic assessment of their potential, criteria for safe use, selection of monitoring indicators, and development of effective protection strategies are possible.

The author published a number of studies, developing the field of dendroecology, applying original approaches independently or in co-authorship. The emphasis of her research is on tree species of conservation importance and their communities in protected territories and zones - Juniperus excelsa M.B. in the Tisata reserve (G5), Taxus baccata L. in the Central Balkan National Park (G1), Pinus peuce Griseb. and P. heldreichii Christ. in NP "Pirin" (F8), Castanea sativa Mill. in Belasitsa National Park and in Berkovskiy Balkan, Picea abies Karst. and Fagus sylvatica L. in Biosphere Reserve "Chuprene", Quercus frainetto Ten. in the "Sokolata" reserve and "Western Stara Planina and For-Balkan" protected areas etc., Pinus nigra Arn. in the maintained reserve "Gabra"; also on Pinus sylvestris L. and Pinus nigra Arn., widely distributed in the vegetation of the country in natural and artificial communities; dendrochronological studies of Quercus rubra L. and Q. robur L. from park areas in the Sofia area - Borisova gradina, Vrana park, Zapaden park, Knyazhevo were carried out, which are important for maintaining a better microclimatic, sanitary and hygienic environment for the capital region. In these initial studies, along with traditional indicators - taxonomy, tree defoliation rate, species composition, storey and dominant structure of forest communities, etc., dendrochronological methods are applied to analyze and model the radial growth of the stems, to establish the growth descriptors regression models and periods of reduced growth (with a growth index below unity); if possible, the sensitivity of the rows, the indicative value of the growth indices for the rows of annual rings, also for the rows of early and late wood, growth-limiting environmental factors were investigated.

Dendrochemical studies have been carried out on the content of chemical elements in the wood and bark of chestnut and Hungarian oak, which are preliminary, but the results are valuable, due to the small number of studies available in this area, the difficulty of conducting them, associated with sampling and the high cost analyses. The obtained results can be the basis for expanding the research and searching for a statistically reliable relationship between the pollution of the environment, the content in the wood and the bark of the studied elements - pollutants and the established stress periods. In one of the publications, a dendroecological assessment of the degree of adverse influence of Loranthus europaeus L. on the radial growth of the stems of slightly and moderately damaged trees in the Natural Park "Belasitsa" was made. The research, with few exceptions, has been carried out mainly on internal university projects, jointly with master\'s students and doctoral students. They were published mainly in collections of reports, and some in Bulgarian journals. One publication is in the field of dendroclimatology - in co-authorship, a reliable reconstruction of the precipitation in South-Western Bulgaria for 200 years was made based on the obtained trend for the dynamics of the growth index of a Hungarian oak tree stand in the \u201cSokolata\u201d Reserve.'}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:'In her subsequent research, the author focused on the identification and analysis of statistically proven stress periods for the sample and the corresponding stand, called "eustress periods", the introduction and precise definition of the term "eustress", or true stress, where the growth index is below 1 (It<1) but the biological system does not lose its adaptive capabilities and, under favorable conditions, can regain or increase the intensity of radial growth (It\u22651), in contrast to the "distress" state, where the outcome is lethal.

To form the samples in the conducted dendroecological studies, the dominant tree species of the first class of Kraft for the respective habitat were probed to minimize the coenotic influences on the radial growth and to enhance the climatic signal to investigate the influence mainly of the variation of temperatures and precipitation on increases.

Another approach was developed in Lyubenova\'s dendroecological research \u2013 identification of climatic types of years for the growth period and search for the prevailing types corresponding to the appearance of eustress. Due to a delay in the response of tree species to impact, in the latest version of the analysis, the "pattern analysis" is developed - the analysis of the climatic type and of two years preceding the occurrence of eustress. For the development of this new dendroecological analysis approach, the "climatic year type" (a calendar year with precipitation and/or temperatures within or outside the climatic norms for precipitation and temperature) was statistically defined, considering the types: HD, CD, ND, HW , CW, NW, NN (H- warm, D \u2013 dry, C- cold, W \u2013 wet, N \u2013 normal). Climatic norms are defined statistically as the average value of precipitation or annual temperatures for 30-year periods together with the confidence interval of these values. The meta-analyses of our own dendrochronological data for different species in Bulgaria and those from the international dendrochronological database prove the applicability of the approach for identifying eustress periods in radial growth, its characteristics and taking into account the influence of climatic types of years (CTs). A study of the relationship of eustress with the standardized precipitation index (SPI) was made and it was confirmed that in the specific case CTs better describe eustress. Greater adequacy of the analyzes would be achieved in determining the biological year and its climatic type. It is specific for each tree species and depends on its ecological features and habitat conditions, includes the months in which there is active life activity and environmental factors significantly influence the vital functions, as well as the months of the previous year, the regimes of which have a significant influence on the current increment. The period of deep dormancy in deciduous trees is excluded from the length of the year. For this purpose, however, systematic and organized studies by region and species are needed on the duration of the growing season, the periods of seed formation and the dynamics of climatic factors.
